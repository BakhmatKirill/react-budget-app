# React-budget-app

This is a simple budget app built using React. The app will create budget categories with the amount allotted. You can then create expense items under the budget category and the app will keep track of how much money you have left to spend in that category.

The user can:

- add expenses which have a name and a cost;
- remove expenses;
- view how much of their budget is remaining;
- view how much they've spent so far;
- edit budget;
- search expenses.
